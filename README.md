# MATURA 2019
This project was created under the graduation-project which researched the creation of a game alongside how games can be measured. The content of this git is therefore published to showcase our work.

## Game

As an alternative, our game is located in [this](/27.10.2019/) folder. (To play it, the whole folder needs to be downloaded)
